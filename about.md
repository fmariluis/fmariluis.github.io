I'm fmariluis, a software developer and political science student from Buenos Aires.

This blog is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted in [ GitHub Pages ](https://pages.github.com/). The font I use is [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville) from Google Fonts.

There are no comments, but if you need to say something, you can submit an [issue](https://github.com/fmariluis/fmariluis.github.io/issues). You can also write me an email, I use Gmail.
